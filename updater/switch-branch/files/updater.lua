--[[
This file is part of switch-branch. Don't edit it.

This script includes test keys if target branch is not in known list of
stable branches.
This excludes mode == "version" as final versions are never signed by test key.

This script also servers as guard that trigger reinstall of all packages when
switch between unstable branches was performed. This is because such branches are
not binary compatible and can provide packages of same version and such packages
would not be reinstalled otherwise.
