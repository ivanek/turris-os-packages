You are currently in: $(get_branch)

You can choose from one of these rolling releases:
  hbs (snails, stable)
    The default and most stable rolling release. Suggested for unexperienced
    users and for critical infrastructure.
  hbt (turtles, testing)
    This rolling release contains next stable version. Please join this branch to
    help us test it and to get new stuff few weeks up-front.
  hbk (kittens, next-fixup)
    This rolling release tracks stable OpenWrt upstream and stable Turris
    development. It is used to prepare next fixup releases (aka 1.0.x). Manual
    intervention might be sometimes required to fix introduced bugs and because of
    that it is suggested to be used only by experienced users.
  hbl (lions, next-minor)
    This rolling release tracks stable OpenWrt upstream and the latest Turris
    development. It is used to prepare next minor releases (aka 1.x.0). Manual
    intervention might be sometimes required to fix introduced bugs and because of
    that it is suggested to be used only by experienced users.
  hbd (dragons, next-major)
    This rolling release not only tracks the latest Turris but also the latest OpenWrt
    development. It is used to prepare next major release (aka x.0.0). It can
    frequently break and is suggested to be used only by experienced users on
    non-critical infrastructure.
